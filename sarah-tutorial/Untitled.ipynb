    "This notebook reads in ANEOS model SESAME-format tables. These are gridded with density and temperature as the independent variables. The table contains pressure, specific internal energy, specific helmholtz free energy, and specific entropy, and sound speed. <p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The density-temperature table is interpolated to generate a density-entropy table. This is the format for the GADGET2 Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code that is one of several SPH codes used to model giant impacts. The density-entropy format table is ideal for internal structure calculations because most planets have an internal pressure-temperature profile that is adiabatic (near an isentrope) as a result of convection. Here, the table is linearly interpolated for expediency and because the original table is finely gridded. It would be better to interpolate using a scheme that preserves thermodynamic consistency in the interpolated points (e.g., http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/dswesty/docs/tcteos.ps). <p>\n",
